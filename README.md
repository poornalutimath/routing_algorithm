# ðŸ”€ Router Pathfinding using Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This C++ program simulates a network of routers and computes the shortest path between them using:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** â€“ for graphs with non-negative weights.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** â€“ handles negative weights and detects negative weight cycles.

It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) and demonstrates templates, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and exception handling.

| Component          | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Router`           | Represents each router with an ID.                                |
| `Edge`             | Represents a connection with cost.                                |
| `Graph<T>`         | A template graph class for managing nodes and edges.              |
| `RoutingAlgorithm` | Abstract class (base) for pathfinding.                            |
| `Dijkstra`         | Inherits from `RoutingAlgorithm` and implements Dijkstraâ€™s logic. |
| `BellmanFord`      | Inherits from `RoutingAlgorithm` and implements Bellman-Ford.     |
| `main()`           | Handles user interaction and runs the chosen algorithm.           |

Learning Outcomes:

Apply OOP principles in real-world simulations.
